Note! We've upgraded some of the dependencies during the process. 
Most importantly, the deno library version in use is now 0.100.0 , 
and the eta version in use is now v1.12.3. and the postgres driver version 
is v0.11.2. This means that the imports that you use when submitting 
assignments need to be adjusted if you are currently working on an assignment 
-- these are the new versions:
--> import { serve } from "https://deno.land/std@0.100.0/http/server.ts";
--> import { configure, renderFile } from "https://deno.land/x/eta@v1.12.3/mod.ts";
--> import { Client } from "https://deno.land/x/postgres@v0.11.2/mod.ts"; 
(or import { Pool } from "https://deno.land/x/postgres@v0.11.2/mod.ts"; 
depending on where you're at in the material)
The materials and the assignment templates have been updated to match the new versions, so 
the above adjustment needs to be only made on the assignments that you are currently working on 
(including the project).
