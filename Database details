- Everything works as expected.
- The tests are really well implemented
- The application displays some table forms, which I find easier to read than each line declaration

- An error "email or password is incorrect" is not displayed when a non existing email, wrong email or wrong password in inputted in login page. This line should be displayed right after redirection
- Errors displayed by wrong registration should be displayed under or on top of the text box field respectively for email and password. 
- Not required but there should be some html file displayed when /static is called instead of an error

- Honestly the application feels easy to use. However, the page /questions/:id has quite large headline and I have to scroll down a lot to add answers, which is a little inconvenient
